# TFM-MADOBIS-Manuel-Medina
This repository contains the code used in my Master's degree Final Project (Trabajo de fin de master, TFM).
Concretely, the code to generate a PCA and a PCA graph of components 1 & 2 on the normalised data obtained experimentally.
The dataset is also included in this repository.
